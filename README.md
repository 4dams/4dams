**Welcome to my GitHub Profile!** I'm a Software Developer from Germany, specialized in Software Development for User Interfaces and Apps. However, I have a lot of experience in writing Backend code, too!

For Frontend or Desktop Applications, I'm mostly working with Angular and Electron. For Backend Apps or Microservices, which I am mostly focusing on right now, it's mostly about Express, NestJS, GraphQL and Apollo. I really love using the latest tech and experimenting with new things – I get bored really fast doing the same things every day. 🤷
