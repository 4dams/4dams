**Welcome to my GitHub Profile!** I am Juri, a 20 years old Software Engineer from Germany. I have a degree in commercial business administration and am currently working full time. I started programming professionally in 2016 and joined [@inexio](https://github.com/inexio) (now Deutsche Glasfaser) as an apprentice in 2018, which is where I am working since!

I am part of the User Interfaces & Apps team where I mostly work with Angular, React, Next.js, and Electron - focused on strictly typed TypeScript.

I also have lots of experience writing large scale Backend Applications with NestJS, GraphQL, and Apollo (Server & Client), working with both SQL and NoSQL Databases such as Firebase and ORMs like Prisma, and many other cool technologies ðŸš€.
